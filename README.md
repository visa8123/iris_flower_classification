## Task : Iris Flower Classification
## Domain : Machine Learning
Problem Statement :

Use the famous Iris dataset to build a model that can classify iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

I have done classificaton using various algorithms like logistic regression, support vector classifer, k nearest neighbors classifier, naive bayes and decision tree classifier and  have made 
accuracy of the all these algorithms.
